**arkdown** is a lightweight markup language designed for maximum readability and ease of publishing, inspired by conventions used in plain text email. It was created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz and is distributed under the **BSD license**. Markdown is used to convert specially formatted text into **XHTML documents**. It has been implemented in various programming languages, including Perl, PHP, Python, and others, and is integrated into content management systems **(CMS)**

### *Common Use Cases and advantages*:

* **Documentation for Code**: Markdown is frequently used to document code repositories, providing clear explanations, usage examples, and code snippets.

* **Technical Manuals**: It's suitable for creating technical manuals, guides, and knowledge base articles due to its structured format.

* **Blogging and Note-Taking**: Markdown's simplicity makes it an excellent choice for bloggers and note-takers who want to focus on content creation.
* **Portability**: Markdown is highly portable. Markdown files can be easily converted into other formats like HTML or PDF, allowing for seamless content sharing across different platforms and devices without compatibility issues.

### *Disadvantages of Markdown*
1. **Limited Formatting**: Markdown offers basic formatting options, but it may lack more advanced formatting features available in other markup languages or document formats.
1. **Accessibility**: Ensuring proper accessibility features, such as alternative text for images or semantic structure, can be more challenging in Markdown compared to other document formats like HTML.
1. **Large Documents**: Handling very large documents in Markdown can become unwieldy, as it lacks features for document navigation, index generation, or document splitting.

## *Why it'd be used in the documentation of our projects*
